### Today {#today}

I'm hustling with the amazing team at [Disney+ Hotstar](https://tech.hotstar.com/) to build a kickass Data Platform in the day.

And when it's not the day, I love tinkering with either classic projects or unconventional ideas. I'm an avid [reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23254685-rounak-datta) (mostly technology and history), [regular cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/70322649), music curator and an aspiring mathematician.

I invest a lot into understanding and researching about **large-scale systems**, the beauty of **mathematics** behind the gears of **artificially intelligent systems**.

Also, I attempt to write [open-source software](https://github.com/rounakdatta). Sometimes [tweets](https://twitter.com/rounakdatta12). And [answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8303407/rounak-datta).
