Quickly get your eLab record generated

- Doesn't matter if questions are incomplete in between

- Evaluates only the completed and verified questions

- Collects all the evaluation reports in JPG format, converts them to PDF and concatenates all the PDFs

- Single PDF file shareable with classmates to share progress

- Uses Python requests, BeautifulSoup instead of (resource heavy and difficult-to-use) Selenium.

**This project is ongoing and is expected to be completed by the end of February 2018.**
