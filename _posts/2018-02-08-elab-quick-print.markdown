- Doesn't matter if questions are incomplete in between

- Accepts C, C++, Java, Python as the available options for program evaluation

- Evaluates only the completed and 100% verified questions

- Collects all the evaluation reports in PNG format, converts them to PDF and concatenates all the PDFs

- Single PDF file shareable with classmates to share progress / as final eLab submission eport

- Uses Python library - _requests_ (for getting the reports) and _img2pdf_ (for converting to PDF) instead of (resource heavy and difficult-to-use) Selenium.

**A web-app is on its way.**
