Once, a less mature version of me started blogging with Google. He just <b>dragged-and dropped</b> things and they worked (of course within bounds). He just kick-started the GUI and things ran. He was blogging effortlessly, yet limitedly.

Then he studied web development and started coding a blog on GitHub. The first version of the blog doesn't have much colours, menus and ads; yet it looks decent (and purposely minimal). Now, the blogging isn't fully effortless (requires manhours), but the possibilities are now expanded to âˆž.
