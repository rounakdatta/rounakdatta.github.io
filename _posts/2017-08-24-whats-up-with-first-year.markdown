First years of any school are the best times to get bamboozled, get focused on studies more than extra-curriculars, be fearful (and incongruous) of taking the unclaimed path of risks. And such and such (in order) happened to me.

Needless to state, but needful to boast that life got fresh juices from the first day of college. Be it the hostel nostalgia or the smell of the industry, college pulled me from being 0.5% to a whole 1%. Pulling up from the bed for breakfast to not missing the snacks (for lethargy) was the daily run of the day. The flow of people made the whole matter joyous. I had to keep up with the stories of mischief of hostellers (I called most of them friends) to be interactive enough in a gathering of ten at the coffee table.

Every meal has its pleasures as well as its complaints. So had our lives. We always ran high on aspirations, be it waking up at 5 for a run or playing football the every alternative day. As you would imagine of, most of the planned things went under the bed with the multiple snoozing of the alarm clock and were eventfully remembered in the deep late night.

Now, I’d write the most important conclusion of the first year:

Mess food, the clumsy teachings of the college, the filthy reality of a private University, the actuality of last-night study, the obligation of self-learning are the crudest learnings of my first year as an academically average student. And last, (but not at all the least) GPA matters but a little bit only.
