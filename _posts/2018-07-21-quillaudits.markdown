Quill Audits uses tweaked Oyente back-end with other sophistications to analyze contracts under-the-hood and return analysis results. Also, it uses **Solidity-Coverage** to provide code coverage tools to analyze if there are are redundant lines of code by running unit tests. Often, redundant lines of code are required to be replaced / removed. Quill Audits is powered by Node.js and is an extremely fast and usable tool for smart contract security analysis.
