I"n<p>Our University admits a large troop of students for undergraduation. And so the hostel booking process becomes difficult (when servers add to the crowd problem). But thatâ€™s totally out of our hands. What this tiny tool could do is host the entire student hostel database when the correct data is inputted by the crowd <em>after hostel booking is over</em>.</p>
