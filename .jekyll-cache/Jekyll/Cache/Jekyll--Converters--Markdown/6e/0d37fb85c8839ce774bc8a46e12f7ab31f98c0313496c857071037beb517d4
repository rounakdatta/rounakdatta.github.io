<p><em>Flyr is an open-source attempt to re-implement Lime, Bird or your favourite bike-sharing platform.</em></p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Flyr is yet another bike-sharing platform, built for profit learning, understanding and re-implementing the robust engineering of such highly available systems. â€˜Flyrâ€™ stupidly means an open-source commute project. The project team aims to write the microservices from scratch, implement bike-sharing algorithms, do a lot of scalability and security engineering. The final product will â€˜at leastâ€™ be able to demonstrate bike-booking, bike-pricing and time-and-route-estimations.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-be-my-commitments-for-this-project">What will be my commitments for this project?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Before coming to a conclusion, read the project README thoroughly. The project demands contributors who can be comfortable enough to write efficient server-side code (design); understand the fundamentals of each back-end component and integrate them; design efficient algorithms (shortest / best distance, dynamic pricing); create minimal and modular front-end for testing.</li>
  <li>This means being fundamentally strong in programming will allow you to quickly pick-up technologies and learn concepts. The process goes as disassemble -&gt; understand -&gt; re-write.</li>
  <li>Scalability and robustness is important. Building protoypes (MVP) are just 15% of a product. You should be able to realise the importance of your code being time and memory-efficient and non-breaking at edge-cases.</li>
  <li>Engineering the product involves understanding, designing and then coding. You should be able to realise the importance of logic (algorithm) before the code itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-i-apply-for-this-project">Should I apply for this project?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you are willing to take up this project seriously, you are more than welcome to apply.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s not totally essential to be accustomed with the technologies mentioned. If you are willing to spend the winter learning them and implementing them here as a side-project, you are welcome to apply.</li>
  <li>This project has to be built from scratch, and everyone will be guiding everyone in the design, understanding and coding. If youâ€™ve done this type of project before and youâ€™re willing to mentor / help out contributors, youâ€™re most welcome.</li>
  <li>If youâ€™re enthusiastic of this project, apply irrespective of whether youâ€™re having the required skillset or not. Youâ€™ll definitely have a great learning curve.</li>
  <li>Your contribution to the project will matter even if itâ€™s a documentation fix.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Please note that this project will accept contributors irrespective of their being in 1st or 2nd or 3rd or 4th year.</code></p>

<h2 id="what-will-be-my-takeaways-from-the-project">What will be my takeaways from the project?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Youâ€™ll <strong>learn</strong> a lot. Whichever responsibility you take up, your time investment will definitely yield a strong conceptual as well as practical understanding of the project components. Particularly, if youâ€™ll be taking up
    <ul>
      <li>Back-End Development, youâ€™ll learn the core pieces of building a data pipeline, learn how microservices work, understand the importance of concurrency, will be confident regarding the choice of a DB system, experiment with streaming large amounts of data and afterall work will multiple existing open-source tools.</li>
      <li>Front-End Development, youâ€™ll write dynamically generated webpages with responsive text, maps, graphs, tables. Therefore involves a lot of API handling, XML HTTPRequests and UX magic.</li>
      <li>Algorithms Development, youâ€™ll be writing efficient algorithms after analyzing how existing systems work. Its fascinating to study and re-implement state-of-the-art algorithms and work them in action in the final product.</li>
      <li>Integration &amp; Testing, youâ€™ll be responsible for connecting the pieces together - find out bottlenecks and scalability issues in the pipeline; also audit the product for breaking cases or security flaws.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Youâ€™ll <strong>work as a team</strong>, closely experience the building of software from scratch as multiple modules and integrating them together.</li>
  <li>A <strong>superb open-source project</strong> - This is a promise from my side.</li>
</ul>
