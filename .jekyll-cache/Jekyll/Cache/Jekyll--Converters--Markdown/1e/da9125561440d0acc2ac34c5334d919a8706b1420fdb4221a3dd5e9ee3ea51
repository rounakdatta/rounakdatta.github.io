I"ë<p>Computer Science fundamentals typically involves the basics of how electronics work in tandem and make the software abstraction happen. Its always important to be sure enough of the internal processing of any system before diving deep into optimization research or even building industry-grade products based on the same. Of course itâ€™s not practical to keep re-inventing wheels in the process of learning science, however its pretty advisable to be confident enough of the little things and their first steps at least. All complex systems can be re-engineered from scratch provided we start with the first principles of it. The key to be better at engineering is to know the inside-out of things while being capable enough to use and debug it. This post tries to stress the importance of fundamental Computer Science courses that are often slipped out of interest probably due to their complexity of understanding amalgamated with their functionality being perfect in their respective domain.</p>
