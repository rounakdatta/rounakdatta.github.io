I")<p>Quill Audits is a smart contract analysis platform provided by QuillHash Technologies. Itâ€™s a fully automated platform for getting smart contracts checked for security vulnerabilities as well as efficiency of code. <strong>Oyente</strong> for Ethereum is currently a trusted automated open-source smart-contract analysis tool. Quill Audits uses tweaked Oyente back-end with other sophistications to analyze contracts under-the-hood and return analysis results. Also, it uses <strong>Solidity-Coverage</strong> to provide code coverage tools to analyze if there are are redundant lines of code by running unit tests. Often, redundant lines of code are required to be replaced / removed. Quill Audits is powered by Node.js and is an extremely fast and usable tool for smart contract security analysis.</p>
