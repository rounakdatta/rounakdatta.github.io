      <description>Redundancy is the key in software engineering ~Paul Klint
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been midway through Designing Data-Intensive Applications and implementing such a distributed system and its algorithms was always on my stack. This implementation tries to cover most of the important aspects, yet largely simplified.
The source for this project is rounakdatta/GoDFS.
Building Go Distributed File System Abstracting away the odds Proven systems like Google FileSystem (GFS) and Hadoop Distributed FileSystem have almost made developers take distributed architectures for granted.</description>

      <description>To what extent do we track our money? Sites and apps are constantly tracking us so closely, with the only intention of knowing us better and presenting us with more self-relatable content (and potentially ads) and engage us even more into the product. We track our shipments, food, health, habits and reasonably quite everything that costs us time. Yeah, of course we do try to keep a sense of our spendings and definitely give a appreciating / regretting thought at the month-end.</description>

      <title>PagerDuty for Things - An interesting IoT project</title>

      <description>An interesting project we worked on being at college was building a PagerDuty-like watchdog for monitoring physical things&#39; state. And the implementation of choice was liquid level.
What&amp;rsquo;s up The project is all about an integration effort of an ESP32-connected weight detection machinery to an online service to unlock possibilities like remote monitoring and alerting. To elucidate, think of remotely monitoring your gas cylinder&amp;rsquo;s fuel level and getting alerted whenever the level drops below a custom-defined threshold.</description>
