      <description>Redundancy is the key in software engineering ~Paul Klint
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been midway through Designing Data-Intensive Applications and implementing such a distributed system and its algorithms was always on my stack. This implementation tries to cover most of the important aspects, yet largely simplified.
The source for this project is rounakdatta/GoDFS.
Building Go Distributed File System Abstracting away the odds Proven systems like Google FileSystem (GFS) and Hadoop Distributed FileSystem have almost made developers take distributed architectures for granted.</description>

      <description>An interesting project we worked on being at college was building a PagerDuty-like watchdog for monitoring physical things&#39; state. And the implementation of choice was liquid level.
What&amp;rsquo;s up The project is all about an integration effort of an ESP32-connected weight detection machinery to an online service to unlock possibilities like remote monitoring and alerting. To elucidate, think of remotely monitoring your gas cylinder&amp;rsquo;s fuel level and getting alerted whenever the level drops below a custom-defined threshold.</description>
