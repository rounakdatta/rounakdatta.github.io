      <description>An interesting project we worked on being at college was building a PagerDuty-like watchdog for monitoring physical things&#39; state. And the implementation of choice was liquid level.
What&amp;rsquo;s up The project is all about an integration effort of an ESP32-connected weight detection machinery to an online service to unlock possibilities like remote monitoring and alerting. To elucidate, think of remotely monitoring your gas cylinder&amp;rsquo;s fuel level and getting alerted whenever the level drops below a custom-defined threshold.</description>
