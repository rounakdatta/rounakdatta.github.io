      <description>Rounak Datta Figure 1: My brother (left) and me
Today Our small, new team at CommandK is attempting to solve a niche problem of streamlining secrets delivery to microservices at fast-growing companies. Previously I had an amazing stint with the Data Platform and Growth Engineering teams at Disney+ Hotstar.
I&amp;rsquo;m an avid reader (mostly technology and history), regular cyclist, music curator (Soundcloud soon) and an aspiring mathematician. Large-scale systems which just work (think financial markets, democracy, submarine cables, city logistics) always fascinate me, and an unconditional hobby of mine is to quantitatively deconstruct these systems.</description>
