      <description>We are at yet another article about Nix - it is a casual attempt to walk you through how it is to use Nix everyday. I also intend to put my two cents into why most people like staying away from it, why a handful are happily sacrificing their weekends over it, and why some blokes are just willing to silently ride the wave. As the homepage says, Nix is both your programming language and the framework.</description>
