I was first introduced to the world of Infrastructure-as-Code through Terraform in 2020. I was introduced to functional programming in 2021. Nix marries the two concepts, and asks you to never look back. My dotfiles repository is my way of telling my operating system what all needs to be installed and configured on my computer - personal or otherwise.
