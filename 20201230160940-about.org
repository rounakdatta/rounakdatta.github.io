* Rounak Datta

** Today
I'm hustling with the amazing team at [[https://tech.hotstar.com/][Disney+ Hotstar]] to build a kickass Data Platform in the day.

And when it's not the day, I love tinkering with either classic projects or unconventional ideas. I'm an avid [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23254685-rounak-datta][reader]] (mostly technology and history), regular cyclist, music curator and an aspiring mathematician.

I invest a lot into understanding and researching about *large-scale systems*, the beauty of *mathematics* behind the gears of *artificially intelligent systems*.

Also, I attempt to write [[https://github.com/rounakdatta][open-source software]]. Sometimes [[https://twitter.com/rounakdatta12][tweets]]. And [[https://stackoverflow.com/users/8303407/rounak-datta][answers]]. [[https://www.instagram.com/rounakdatta/][Artworks]] are my favourite pastime.

** Also
- Engineering Intern (F19) with [[https://gaiusnetworks.com/][Gaius Networks]]; designed and developed some of the core services like Community, Classrooms, Content Curation.
- Engineering Intern (W18), NLP Intern (S18) with [[https://www.guvi.in/][Guvi Geek Networks]]; helped craft some impactful projects like personalised learning platform, scalable resume parser and a grammar-correction tool (open source! ðŸ˜‰).
- Blockchain Research Intern (S18) with [[https://quillhash.com/][QuillHash Technologies]]; put on security research hats, and got to fiddle with smart contract security tooling, Security Tokens and Inter-Blockchain Communication.
- Student researcher at [[https://nextech.io/][Next Tech Lab]]; experimented with cutting-edge technology with special focus on InfoSec, Blockchain & AI algorithms. Also conquered a couple of national hackathons.
